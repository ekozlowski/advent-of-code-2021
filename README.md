# Advent Of Code 2021

These are my personal solutions for the Advent of Code challenge for 2021.

I would encourage you to participate, and track your own solutions to the challenges.   

You can use any programming language you like.

Advent of Code is here -> https://adventofcode.com

I use Python, and have been learning Node.JS and refreshing my C.  (It's been a while)
